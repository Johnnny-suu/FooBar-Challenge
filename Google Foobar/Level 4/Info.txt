key.py --> Combinatorics problem
	
	Each lock is numbered starting from 0. The keys are numbered the same as the lock they open (so for a duplicate key, the number will repeat, since it opens the same lock). 
	For a given bunny, the keys they get is represented as a sorted list of the numbers for the keys. 
	To cover all of the bunnies, the final answer is represented by a sorted list of each individual bunny's list of keys. 
	Find the lexicographically least such key distribution - that is, the first bunny should have keys sequentially starting from 0.
